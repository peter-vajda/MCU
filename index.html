    <p>
        The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is an American media franchise and shared universe centered on a series of superhero films produced <br>
         by Marvel Studios. The films are based on characters that appear in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The franchise also <br>  
          includes television series, short films, digital series, and literature. The shared universe, much like the original Marvel Universe in <br>
          comic books, was established by crossing over common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters. <br>

        The first MCU film is Iron Man (2008), which began the films of Phase One culminating in the crossover film The Avengers (2012). <br>
         Phase Two began with Iron Man 3 (2013) and concluded with Ant-Man (2015). Phase Three began with Captain America: Civil War (2016) <br>
         and concluded with Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019). The first three phases in the franchise are collectively known as <br>
         "The Infinity Saga". The films of Phase Four began with Black Widow (2021). <br>
        
        Marvel Television expanded the universe to network television with Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. on ABC in 2013, before further expanding <br>
         to streaming television on Netflix and Hulu, and cable television on Freeform. They also produced the digital series <br>
         Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Slingshot. Marvel Studios began producing their own television series for streaming on Disney+, <br>
         starting with WandaVision in 2021 as the beginning of Phase Four. The MCU also includes tie-in comics published by Marvel Comics, <br>
         a series of direct-to-video short films called Marvel One-Shots, and viral marketing campaigns for the films featuring the faux news <br>
         programs WHIH Newsfront and TheDailyBugle.net. <br>
        
        The franchise has been commercially successful and has generally received positive reviews. It has inspired other film and television <br>
        studios to attempt to create similar shared universes with comic book character adaptations. The MCU has also inspired several themed <br>
        attractions, an art exhibit, two television specials, guidebooks for each film, multiple tie-in video games, and commercials. <br>
